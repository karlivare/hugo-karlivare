title: "Yarn Over"
problem: "How can I design an e-commerce site that consolidates crochet patterns from various platforms into one user-friendly solution?"
context: "Crocheting has become a favorite pastime, but finding patterns across various platforms can be frustrating. Currently, no single marketplace is dedicated solely to crochet, making it hard to track crochet-specific patterns. My senior project, Yarn Over, solves this by offering authentic patterns in one easy-to-access place."
action1: "In designing Yarn Over, I conducted research to understand crocheters' frustrations with current pattern-finding methods, which informed the site's features and architecture. I developed a brand identity, including a logo, typography, color palette, and a design system in Figma. After completing wireframes and mockups, I created a prototype with interactions for navigation, filters, carousels, and products."
impact: "This project gave me a better understanding of a design system, specifically keeping a well-maintained system of styles, variables, components, and variants to facilitate efficient designs that were ready to scale from wireframes to a prototype."
